    "# Template likelihood\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we analyse a particular template dataset concerning social biases and the likelihood of its templates. We depart from [@kiritchenkoExaminingGenderRace2018](https://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/Biases-SA.html)'s EEC dataset which is a sentiment analysis benchmark, created with the intent of measuring bias of LMs on a downstream task performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The hypothesis we are exploring is that the templates are unlikely under the model distribution and, for that reason, unreliable. We would like to propose that bias benchmarks should be grounded on the pretraining data and that evaluating bias should consider sequences that the model was actually trained on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook is organized as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Templates gathering**: we collect the templates in the original EEC and complement them with variations including \"my\", \"the\", \"this\", \"a\", \"an\". We expand templates with the format `... {placeholder1} ... {placeholder2} ...` to be `... {placeholder1} ... emotion1 ...`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model scoring**: for every template T of the format `... {placeholder1} ... emotion1 ...` (where emotion1 is a fixed emotion) we compute its marginal probability by computing the score for every {placeholder} in vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. **Persist scores**: we persist the scores in a zip file to carry on analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Ground sequences scores on model distribution**: compute the quantile for each template of length l, when comparing with randomly sampled sequences from the model distribution.\n",
    "    - How likely are these sequences?\n",
    "    - How does the likelihood of different decoding algorithms leads to different scoring?"
