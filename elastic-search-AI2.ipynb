      "North Hills Hospital is proud to be hosting one of the largest emergency preparedness drills ever held in the state of Texas this week. We will be partnering with the North Central Texas Trauma Regional Advisory Council (NCTTRAC) and first responders from throughout North Texas to test our equipment and processes so that when a real disaster happens, we’re all ready to respond. (Which as we all know. this disaster has a miraculous chance of happening during the drill and close enough to respond and look good. HEROES! ‘Stead of Scumbags R US. Wink wink, nudge nudge… Drills? US don’t need no stinking drills – for exactly what is happening for US to look good. Makes me wanna’ puke watching TV and these scumbags. Oh, and their prayers for Boston. Which will soon be followed by their ‘prayers’ for Waco. And all the while they never heard of DRILLS. “Drills? – What are you talking about?” is all the ‘herd’ gets.) This drill is even timelier in the wake of the bombings at Monday’s Boston Marathon. Our prayers go out to the victims involved, and we are proud of the first responders – EMS, fire, police, race workers, and hospital staff – who so bravely cared for the injured. If you live near North Hills Hospital, you will see a lot of activity in our parking lots over the next three days as the NCTTRAC sets up a mobile 140-bed hospital, along with dozens of ambulances, several AMBUS (multi-patient ambulances), and helicopters. This is only a drill and will simulate a hospital evacuation, something that might be necessary in the event of a tornado, hurricane, earthquake, or prolonged power failure. Set-up for the drill will take place Tuesday and Wednesday, with the drill occurring on Thursday. At no time will regular patient care be affected, as the drill will use only “actor” patients and be confined to non-patient care areas and the parking lot.” http://intellihub.com/2013/04/18/texas-mass-casuality-drill-apparently-cancelled-following-waco-explosion/\n",

How does an underground storage catch fire and explode from an above ground flame? Frame by frame revealed no missile that I could see. There is clearly the typical nuke pattern mushroom appearing again on solid ground and no sign of structure that I could see previously. But, a mushroom would also be common and very similar to a nuke when large amounts – many tons 30 to 40 on a semi to make a crater for very close detonation of TNT – so you need a lot and it needs to be packed close. http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/2013/04/18/what-mushroom-clouds-can-reveal-about-the-waco-explosion/ But, TNT can come no where close to nuke heat and brightness.

This fertilizer is a gravel-like solid, making it far easier to handle and transport. But when mixed with a fuel and ignited, it becomes a powerful explosive.” “At the Texas fertilizer plant, something else served as a fuel:” This is all correct information pulled from a pile of government propaganda. So apparently the theory is that a gas, that was burning – but left enough to infiltrate Ammonium Nitrate to such a degree that it was equivalent to being soaked in a flammable liquid. Ah, the miracles that happen in drills. (Awaiting new shill discovery of ‘new super duper DEW Thermite Gas’?) * “Anhydrous ammonia – However, ammonia vapor in high concentrations (16 to 25 percent by weight in air) will burn.” And, “Ammonia will combine with mercury to form a fulminate which is an unstable explosive compound.” http://svasd.com/images/1pm_Williams.pdf How this vapor ‘defied the physics of wind on a gas’, “miraculously” escaped the fire that caused it?, or was the cause?, or how Mercury might somehow cause it to be explosive instead of the ‘deflagration mixture’ that it is, still await the BS circular file.\n",

SUMNER et al., Defendants (The Methodist Medical Center of Illinois, Defendant-Appellee).\\nNo. 3-86-0713.\\nIllinois Appellate Court \\x97 Third District.\\nOpinion filed September 3, 1987.\\nJack Vieley, of Peoria (Dean R. Essig, of counsel), for appellant.\\nWayne L. Hanold, of Westervelt, Johnson, Nicoll & Keller, of Peoria (James R. Morrison, of counsel), for appellee.\\nJudgment affirmed.\\nJUSTICE SCOTT delivered the opinion of the court:\\nPlaintiff, Debra K. Johnson, brought this action for medical malpractice alleging that Drs. Ronald E. Sumner, William Hart, Lorris M. Bowers, and The Methodist Medical Center of Illinois were negligent when rendering her treatment in the emergency room and following her admission to the hospital. Johnson appeals the order entered by the circuit court of Peoria County granting the hospital\\'s *174 motion for summary judgment based on grounds that the emergency room physician attending her was an employee of Hospital Emergency Physicians, S.C., an Illinois medical corporation, and was not an agent of the hospital. The sole issue presented for review is whether the record presented to the trial court was sufficient at law to warrant granting of the hospital\\'s motion for summary judgment.\\nOn the evening of June 25, 1978, Debra K. Johnson developed abdominal pains and on the advice of her family physician, Dr. Sumner, entered the emergency room of The Methodist Medical Center. Johnson was initially examined by Dr. Steven Driggers, a resident in training at the hospital and, as stated in an affidavit submitted to the trial court, an employee of Hospital Emergency Physicians, S.C. Johnson also was later examined by Dr. Sumner and a surgeon, Dr. Hart. The physicians\\' diagnosis was that she was suffering from appendicitis and an appendectomy was recommended. A pelvic examination was not made by Dr. Driggers when she entered the emergency room, but prior to surgery and following admission to the hospital a tube test for pregnancy revealed an initial positive finding. When the test results were reported, it was suggested that the test be repeated in three to five days to confirm the positive finding, but the test was not re-ordered.\\nFollowing her surgery and discharge from the hospital, Johnson continued to experience pain and discomfort. Approximately two months later she underwent another surgery at Peoria\\'s St. Francis Hospital for removal of a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. During this surgery Johnson\\'s fallopian tubes were removed, rendering her sterile.\\nJohnson\\'s complaint alleged, among other things, that Methodist Medical Center by its \"agents and servants\" was negligent in the diagnosis of her condition and in the treatment she received in the emergency room and the hospital. Her complaint also stated that Dr. Driggers, the emergency room examining physician, was an agent of the hospital. In a hearing on the hospital\\'s motion for summary judgment, the trial court was presented with the uncontradicted affidavit of the hospital\\'s vice-president stating that Dr. Driggers was working as an employee of Hospital Emergency Physicians, S.C., when he examined Johnson. The affidavit also stated that the hospital had entered into a written agreement with Hospital Emergency Physicians, S.C., wherein Hospital Emergency Physicians would provide physicians for the purpose of rendering emergency room medical services. Further, that the agreement provided (1) that the hospital would guarantee the corporation a \"cash flow\" of $40,000 per month; (2) that the corporation would directly bill patients for emergency room *175 care; (3) that the corporation, through a director chosen from the physicians provided by the corporation, would exercise overall supervision of the care and services provided in the emergency room; and (4) that the corporation would provide training, instruction, and clinic directions to the staff of the hospital in regard to emergency care services.\\nJohnson on appeal asserts that the relationship between the hospital, the emergency room physicians, and Hospital Emergency Physicians, S.C., raises factual issues which preclude the trial court from granting summary judgment to the hospital. She maintains that the emergency room physicians may be held to be agents of the hospital, thereby allowing imputation of vicarious liability as a matter of law to the hospital for physicians\\' actions which may be found to be negligent. In argument presented on appeal, Johnson also requests this court reconsider its position of declining to extend the doctrine of apparent agency in a tort action for medical malpractice.\\nIn our recent decision rendered in Greene v. Rogers (1986), 147 Ill. App.3d 1009, 498 N.E.2d 867, this court declined to extend the doctrine of apparent agency in a tort action for medical malpractice. The facts and circumstances Johnson offers in support of the extension and application of the principle of apparent authority closely parallel those cited by the appellant in Greene, e.g., admission forms with the hospital\\'s logo. We, however, are not persuaded this doctrine recognizes the realities of the typical hospital-physician relationship wherein the physician directs treatment, orders tests, etc.; nor that the application of this doctrine promotes a basic public policy of tort law that the tortfeasor be financially responsible to the injured party for his misconduct. Hospital Emergency Physicians, S.C., by written agreement with the hospital, assumed the responsibility of directly supervising the care and services provided emergency room admittees by the emergency room physicians. The medical decision of whether or not to order a pelvic examination rested with the attending emergency room physician, who by agreement was being supervised by Hospital Emergency Physicians, S.C. The failure to order the examination, if found to be negligent, we hold should be imputed to the hospital only if the examining physician is found to be an express agent of the hospital, not through an extension and application of the doctrine of apparent agency. Greene v. Rogers (1986), 147 Ill. App.3d 1009, 498 N.E.2d 867; Johnson v. St. Bernard Hospital (1979), 79 Ill. App.3d 709, 399 N.E.2d 198; Pickle v. Curns (1982), 106 Ill. App.3d 734, 435 N.E.2d 877.\\n\\x95 1 Johnson contends there exists a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Dr. Driggers was an express agent of the hospital, *176 thereby allowing imputation of vicarious liability to Methodist Medical Center. To establish the existence of a principal-agent relationship in the medical setting, control of a physician\\'s actions must be found to reside in the hospital and payment to the physician for services rendered patients be made to the hospital. Garfield Park Community Hospital v. Vitacco (1975), 27 Ill. App.3d 741, 327 N.E.2d 408.\\nThe Methodist Medical Center presented to the trial court an uncontradicted affidavit that Dr. Driggers, at the time of his examination of Johnson, was an employee of Hospital Emergency Physicians, S.C. The complete agreement between the hospital and Hospital Emergency Physicians, S.C., was also presented to the trial court. As noted above, this agreement stipulated, among other things, that Hospital Emergency Physicians, S.C., was responsible for employment, retention, and supervision of emergency care physicians such as Dr. Driggers. Though the agreement required emergency room physicians be members of the hospital staff, there was no showing this provision allowed the hospital to control the medical diagnosis and treatment decision making of the emergency room physicians. The policies and procedures outlined in the agreement with respect to providing emergency care services we find do not establish the existence of an agency relationship insofar as the hospital\\'s having control over physician treatments and diagnoses.\\n\\x95 2 With respect to payment of emergency room physicians, the hospital guaranteed Hospital Emergency Physicians, S.C., a \"cash flow\" of $40,000 per month. The corporation\\'s patient billings which were in excess of this sum, if any, were remitted to the hospital. Though the issue of the source of the emergency room physicians\\' compensation has not been raised, we find that given Hospital Emergency Physicians, S.C., employed the physicians and directly billed emergency room patients for physicians\\' services, the guarantee of a monthly cash flow does not constitute a direct payment establishing an express agency relationship between the physicians and the hospital.\\n\\x95 3 It is well settled that a party is entitled to a grant of summary judgment as a matter of law when the pleadings, depositions, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact. (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1985, ch. 110, par. 2-1005(c); Ruby v. Wayman (1968), 99 Ill. App.2d 146, 240 N.E.2d 699.) While Johnson is not required to prove her case in response to the hospital\\'s motion for summary judgment, she is required to present sufficient factual basis to entitle her to a judgment under applicable law. (Wooding v. L & J Press Corp. (1981), 99 Ill. App.3d 382, *177 425 N.E.2d 1055; Conrad v. Christ Community Hospital (1979), 77 Ill. App.3d 337, 395 N.E.2d 1158.) Our review of the record reveals that Johnson has not met this burden. We therefore find no error in the lower court\\'s ruling that no agency relationship, either express or apparent, could be found to exist between the physicians provided by Hospital Emergency Physicians, S.C., and The Methodist Medical Center, and therefore no genuine issue of material fact existed as to the liability of The Methodist Medical Center to Johnson.\\nAccordingly, the summary judgment entered by the circuit court of Peoria County is affirmed.\\nAffirmed.\\nBARRY, P.J., and STOUDER, J., concur.\\n',\n",

A review of events of the week\\n\\nStaff Writer\\n\\nSaturday, September 29, 2018\\n\\nGUYMON, OK\\n\\nThis week brought questions as to the status of Memorial Hospital of Texas Co. emergency room. The following is a timeline of the events of the week. We will continue to update as more information becomes available.\\n\\nOn Monday evening, the Guymon Daily Herald was contacted with questions pertaining to the status of the emergency room at Memorial Hospital of Texas County. It was learned that only on Monday, the emergency room was advising ambulances to divert trauma cases to other facilities.\\nContact was made with COO Mike Carter, who stated the emergency room was not closed down. No further details were immediately given on the situation, other than the ER would remain open.\\nAn anonymous source later sent a letter with a letterhead from Emergency Staffing Solutions dated Sept. 21, in which the company was demanding payment by 3 p.m. Central Standard Time, or they would \"be forced to pull coverage immediately\".\\nCEO Doug Swim stated the hospital administration had not received the letter.\\nThe hospital also faces a suit that has been filed with the Texas County Courthouse from Onestaff Medical, LLC. The affidavit states the hospital has failed to pay as agreed for services provided for the period of May through August 2017. The contract would have taken place while the hospital was in a contract with Little River Healthcare and its subsidiary, Timberlands Healthcare. That contract was terminated following news that Little River had closed down a hospital in Texas, and was in the process of filing for bankruptcy. The contract included with the court filing was signed by former CEO Jimmy Stuart.\\nThe Guymon Daily Herald continues to seek further information on the payment and contract disputes from hospital officials and will report as more becomes available.\\n\\nConfusion reigned on Monday afternoon following information that Guymon Emergency Medical Services was notified by the Memorial Hospital of Texas County emergency room nursing staff that no emergency room physician was available on Sept. 24 as of 3 p.m.\\nA letter was forwarded from Dr. Jeffrey Lim, who serves as the medical director for Guymon Emergency Medical Services. Guymon EMS has since been diverting patients to surrounding area hospitals based on the clinical status of the patients. Dr. Lim sought further information from hospital administration in regards to the hospital\\'s status.\\nIn the email, Dr. Lim stated: \"I would also like to reiterate that Guymon EMS has to be informed in a timely manner when essential ancillary services such as but not limited to arterial blood gases, cardiac injury profiles, protime/international normalized ratios, radiologic studies are unavailable. The Guymon EMS should also be informed when thrombolytics for use in acute strokes and snake antivenom is unavailable.\"\\nDr. Lim stated on Tuesday morning that the incident had been reported to the Oklahoma State Department of Health for investigation, and that Guymon EMS would continue to divert patients to other area hospitals until he could receive a written guarantee the emergency room can provide minimum standards of medical care to Texas County residents. The Oklahoma State Department of Health was unable to comment on the matter.\\nAn anonymous source purportedly intercepted a letter appearing to be from Emergency Staffing Solutions in which payment had been demanded, or the agency would terminate coverage. The letter demanded an immediate payment There was no confirmation that the letter had been delivered to or received by MHTC administrators.\\nOn Monday afternoon, CEO Doug Swim stated that neither he nor COO Mike Carter had received or seen the letter in question. Swim released only a brief statement at the end of Monday, stating the following:\\n\"Memorial Hospital of Texas County is open and will remain open. The emergency room is open and will remain open. Thank you so much for your support.\"\\nThe Guymon Daily Herald continues to seek further comment from hospital administration.\\nA message was left with Emergency Staffing Solutions for comment, but the call was not returned before deadline.\\n\\nWednesday:\\nMHTC administration states hospital is operational, solvent\\nBy April Coblegdhreporter@gmail.com\\n\\nMemorial Hospital of Texas County administration has faced a week of questions and meetings following claims the emergency room was closed down and diverting ambulances to other area hospitals.\\nA demand for a written guarantee the emergency room can provide minimum standards of medical care to residents was emailed directly to hospital administrators from Dr. Jeffrey Lim. Dr. Lim stated in the email that ambulances would continue to divert until the guarantee was delivered.\\nAn anonymous source intercepted a letter from Emergency Staffing Solutions (ESS), the company that had provided emergency room physicians, in which a demand for payment appeared to be sent to COO Mike Carter. That demand came with a Sept. 24 at 3 p.m. deadline, or the company would pull coverage.\\nAdministration stated the diversion was to give new covering physicians an orientation period and that the emergency room remained open.\\nThe letter from ESS was signed by Shonda Rupe, who interviewed with the Oklahoman. Rupe did not return a call with request for comment from the Guymon Daily Herald. In the interview, Rupe claimed the hospital missed three payments. The letter stated if ESS did not receive a $25,000 payment, coverage would be pulled.\\nRupe also told The Oklahoman that Swim and Carter told her the hospital would likely file for bankruptcy and had \"no hope\" of paying its debts.\\n\"They really just left us no choice,\" Rupe told The Oklahoman.\\nSwim and Carter both denied any discussion on bankruptcy, with Carter stating bankruptcy is not even a consideration, and the hospital remains solvent.\\n\"We are providing everything we can for medical care for the community,\" Swim said.\\nWhile Guymon EMS continues to divert ambulances, Swim stated there is no reason to do so, as the hospital is staffed and supplied to provide medical care to Texas County.\\nOn Monday afternoon, Swim followed up talk about the emergency room with the following statement:\\n\"Memorial Hospital of Texas County is open and will remain open. The emergency room is open and will remain open.\"\\nOne reader, Becky Edenborough Chase, verified on Monday evening that the emergency room was indeed open, after taking her mother there following a falling injury.\\n\"We had excellent car at the open ER and everyone who took care of her before, during and after surgery,\" Chase wrote.\\nChase added not having a local emergency room would be a big inconvenience, and credited MHTC for her parents both being here today, noting there may not be enough time for a trip to another area hospital in an emergency.\\nBoard of Trustees President Harold Tyson also met with administrators on Wednesday morning to address questions pertaining to operations and the status of the hospital. Tyson stated he and administration want to reassure the community that the hospital is strong and running good.',\n",

People want their care quickly,” said Ronald Strony, M.D., director of emergency medicine at Geisinger Northeast. “Because of this, the use of the emergency department has gone up exponentially.”\\n\\nIn fiscal year 2010, uncompensated care levels at hospitals across the state grew 8 percent, equaling $891 million in fiscal 2010, according to independent state agency Pennsylvania Health Care Cost Containment Council. About 46 percent of that was categorized as charity care. The rest was written off as bad debt, according to the council’s report.\\n\\nBecause of these pressures, hospitals across the country are focusing on getting patients the right treatment in the right place, Strony said. The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act passed in 1986 requires hospitals to provide an appropriate medical screening examination for any patient seeking treatment in the emergency room. Through those exams, medical staff ascertain whether the patient’s complaint is an emergency. A number of hospitals, both for-profit and nonprofit, around the country have implemented policies requiring patients to pay upfront for care that is deemed to be non-urgent.\\n\\nFor-profit Community Health Systems Inc., which owns eight hospitals across the region and more than 130 hospitals around the nation, screens emergency room patients as required.\\n“For those who decide to request non-emergency care in the ER, the hospital may collect a fee or the patient’s co-pay for the service provided, just as is done in a physician’s office or outpatient clinic,” CHS spokeswoman Tomi Galin wrote in an email. “These policies have been implemented at CHS-affiliated hospitals at various times over the past few years.”\\n\\nPrior to their acquisitions, Wilkes-Barre General Hospital, Regional Hospital of Scranton and Moses Taylor Hospital each made some effort to secure patient payments in the emergency room for the services provided, according to Jim McGuire, spokesman for umbrella group Commonwealth Health. “The ownership change of these hospitals has not resulted in a change of process at this time,” he said. “It is always the patient’s choice whether to continue care in our emergency department or seek care in an alternate setting, such as their physician’s office or an urgent care clinic.”\\n\\nWhile there are no policies requiring upfront payment at Geisinger hospitals, emergency room staff there also will have discussions with patients about options for non-emergency care, Dr. Strony said, including an on-site urgent care clinic.\\n\\nMoving non-emergency cases to clinics and doctors’ offices makes sense on a number of levels, the doctor said. It frees up emergency room beds for sicker patients and gets non-urgent cases treated faster. In addition to reducing costs at hospitals, receiving care at clinics or doctor’s offices is often less costly than emergency room care. “A co-pay at the (emergency room) is $75 to $100. At an urgent care clinic, it’s $10,” he said. “That’s a no-brainer for the patients.”\\n\\nFor more information about how you can improve emergency rooms cash collections, contact Phil C.

A cross-sectional design was used of a nationally constructed data set of hospital-based emergency departments of over 6,000 hospitals in the United States. We identified our quality outcome measure as the emergency room visits rate within a hospital service area. We created the variable by dividing the number of emergency room visits by the population of the hospital services area in which the emergency room was located. Results indicate that there is a difference in the incident rate ratio of emergency room visits between environments considered to be experiencing greater amounts of hazard, compared to lower amounts of hazard. Hospital administrators and health policy-makers need to work in conjunction to focus efforts on public safety as a key objective in the delivery of emergency medical care. One crucial effort that hospital administrators need to focus on is improving emergency room capacity and efficiency as part of the disaster preparedness plan (Disaster Med Public Health Prep. 2019;13:470-475).',\n",
